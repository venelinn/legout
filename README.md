# Using Contentful with i18n plugin

## **UPGRADED TO GATSBY v2**
1st pass at an upgrade, all things are working that I can see. Removed the layout component and added the Header manually to all 4 places as a quick and dirty fix: US/DE index pages and category & product pages.

## Details
To build on the [Using Contentful](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-contentful) example site using the [i18n community plugin](https://github.com/angeloocana/gatsby-plugin-i18n), this starter repo shows a language switcher and the bilingual content only for the selected language (codes en-US and de).
